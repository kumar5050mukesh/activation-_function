    "\"\"\"Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. Here are some ways in\n",
    " which activation functions affect neural network training:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-Linearity: Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to model and learn complex \n",
    "relationships in the data. Without non-linear activation functions, a neural network would be limited to representing only \n",
    "linear mappings, severely restricting its capability to handle real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gradient Flow and Vanishing/Exploding Gradients: Activation functions affect the flow of gradients during backpropagation,\n",
    " which is essential for updating the network weights. If an activation function has derivatives that are close to zero for \n",
    " most input values (e.g., sigmoid or tanh functions), it can cause the gradients to vanish, making it difficult for deep \n",
    " networks to propagate meaningful gradients through layers. On the other hand, activation functions with large derivatives\n",
    "  (e.g., ReLU) can lead to exploding gradients. Proper choice of activation function can help alleviate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activation Range and Output Distribution: Activation functions determine the range of values that neurons can output. \n",
    "Some activation functions like sigmoid and tanh squash the output into specific ranges (e.g., between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1). \n",
    "This can affect the distribution of values in the network, which in turn impacts convergence, stability, and the ability to\n",
    " model different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sparsity and Activation Sparsity: Certain activation functions, such as ReLU and its variants, promote sparsity in the\n",
    " network by setting many neuron outputs to zero. This can lead to more efficient network representations and computational\n",
    "  savings during training and inference. However, it can also introduce a \"dead neuron\" problem if a large number of neurons\n",
    "   get stuck at zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Computational Efficiency: Different activation functions have varying computational requirements. Simple activation \n",
    "functions like ReLU are computationally efficient, whereas more complex functions like sigmoid and tanh involve exponential\n",

    "Advantages of the sigmoidal activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Interpretability: The sigmoid function can be interpreted unambiguously as a probability. This is useful in binary\n",

    " This linearity simplifies computation and can improve the training process.\n",
    "3. Vanishing Gradient: The sigmoid function can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. Large input values ​​have small\n",

    "\"\"\"Using a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function rather than a sigmoidal activation function offers several advantages\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. Avoiding the Vanishing Gradient Problem: The sigmoidal activation function has a derivative that tends to zero for large \n",
    " positive and negative inputs, which can cause the gradient to vanish during backpropagation . ReLU, on the other hand, has a \n",

    "3. Improved nonlinearity: The sigmoidal activation function introduces nonlinearity, but it saturates for large positive and\n",
    " negative inputs, resulting in saturated gradients and slower learning. ReLU provides a more linear response to positive inputs,\n",
    "  allowing the network to learn faster. This nonlinearity increase is beneficial for capturing complex patterns and increasing\n",
    "   the expressiveness of the network.\n",
    "4. Sparse activation: ReLU has the property of sparse activation. This means that only a subset of neurons can be activated while\n",

    " Sparse activation also helps reduce overfitting by reducing the network's capacity to store training data.\n",

    "problem encountered in deep neural networks. It introduces a small slope for negative inputs, allowing a small, non-zero \n",

    "f(x) = max(αx, x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where α is a small constant (< 1) that determines the slope of the negative part of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of leaky ReLU can be explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Addressing the Vanishing Gradient Problem: The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients diminish significantly \n",
    "as they propagate backward through multiple layers during training. This can hinder the convergence and learning of deep \n",
    "neural networks. In traditional ReLU, the gradient is completely zero for negative inputs, effectively blocking any backward\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Non-Zero Gradient for Negative Inputs: The primary advantage of leaky ReLU is that it prevents dead neurons, which are neurons\n",
    " that never activate and remain dormant throughout the training process. With a non-zero gradient for negative inputs, even neurons\n",
    "  that receive large negative values during training can still update their weights and learn from the gradient signal. This ensures\n",
    "   that all neurons contribute to the learning process, improving the overall effectiveness of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adaptability: Unlike the traditional ReLU activation function, the slope of the leaky ReLU for negative inputs is not fixed. \n",

    "# Q8. What is the purpose of the softmax activation function? When is it commonly used?\n",
    "\"\"\"The softmax activation function is commonly used in neural networks, particularly in multi-class classification problems.\n",
    " Its primary purpose is to convert a vector of real-valued numbers into a probability distribution over multiple classes,\n",
    "  where the sum of the probabilities across all classes is equal to 1. The softmax function is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "softmax(x_i) = exp(x_i) / sum(exp(x_j))\n",
    "\n",
    "where x_i represents the input value for class i, and the sum is taken over all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax activation function serves the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Probability Distribution: Softmax transforms the input values into a probability distribution by ensuring that each class\n",
    " probability is between 0 and 1. It achieves this by exponentiating the input values and normalizing them with respect to the\n",
    "  sum of the exponentiated values. This property makes softmax useful when the goal is to assign mutually exclusive \n",
    "  probabilities to different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Output Interpretability: The softmax function provides a clear interpretation of the network's output as class \n",

    " class. This is especially valuable in multi-class classification tasks, where the goal is to assign an input to one of \n",

    "3. Zero Centered: The advantage of the Tanh function over the sigmoid function is that it is zero centered. This means that \n",

    "results in larger gradients and provides a stronger signal for weight updates, resulting in faster convergence during the \n",
    "training process.\n",
    "5. Symmetry: The Tanh function is symmetric about the origin. This means it is an odd function (tanh(-x) = -tanh(x)). \n",
    "This property of symmetry is useful in certain cases, especially when dealing with symmetric data distributions or when \n",

    "  limitations.\n",
    "Overall, Tanh activation functions are often used in certain contexts such as hidden layers in recurrent neural networks \n",
